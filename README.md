# My-self-directed-project-medicalai-
This self directed study project focused on the practical application of AI in the medical field, specifically exploring the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for medical image analysis. The project aimed to not only develop a functional CNN model but also to create a user-friendly interface (UI) for interacting with the model.
